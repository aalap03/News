# News
This project is uses news org API to fetch latest news of different categories. 
I have developed this project in kotlin, with MVP architecture, and used libraries like Retrofit, RxJava, Realm for data persistence, for offline news access.
I have also provided view preferences to give different feel, with dark mode theme alongside using layout like grid and compact.
