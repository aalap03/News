# News
This project is uses news org API to fetch latest news of different categories. 
I have developed this project in kotlin, with MVP architecture, and used libraries like Retrofit, RxJava, Realm for data persistence, for offline news access.
I have also provided view preferences to give different feel, with dark mode theme alongside using layout like grid and compact. 

User can also favourite news, and view it later, plus search news by any keyword.

User can also view weather of current city, with of daily of 8 days and 48 hours.
